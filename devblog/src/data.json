However, when I tried to load the images into the game, it displayed seemingly random images. I spent over an hour searching for the error until I found it. The -os.walk()- Python function traverses the directory and returns the path, but not in order, for example, it returned 210 after 21, instead of 22. I had thought of this last, so it took a lot of time, but fortunately, I managed to solve it with a little sorting method.",

I also created a building layer in Tiled and made a small village. Furthermore, I added some animations to the player, including move, idle, and attack animations. However, there are a few bugs with the images because some corners became visible during the splitting process. I will fix it later. Additionally, I need to optimize any graphics-related items since there are many unnecessary files.",

The player can now attack with multiple weapons, but they need to collect the weapons before they can use them, which will be integrated with the inventory/quest system. I have added the images related to the player, and this is an awesome feature in pygame. Additionally, I have created a small video showcasing the progress, which you can see below.",

However, you need to restart the game twice for it to work properly, so it's not yet one of the most well-functioning systems.",
